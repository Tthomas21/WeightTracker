# WeightTracker
Android Application
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For this project, I was tasked with building an android mobile application using android studio. The name of the application is Weight Tacker, the goal of weight track is to allow a user to login to the app on their phone and track their daily weight. The user also needs to be able to set a goal weight and then receive a notifcatiion when they reached their desired goal weight. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app required a login screen, a weight tracking screen, a screen for updating and deleting a weight entry, and also a screen for setting a goal weight. The main UI features required was the view layout for the ability to update, see, and delete weight entries. The application also required the use of a database, SQLite was the chose database language. Some UI elements that were useful for the user was the layout view, and the ability to easily add new information and see it on the screen. I went with a simple design approach and ensured that the requirements of the application were met and functional. I believe this is what made my design successful.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The approach I took for coding my app was to have a strong design with the features I wanted to implement, and then identify what I needed to code in order to make my designs come to fruitition. I think the most effective strategy I used was incremental development, development each portion of the code in chunks and then testing for functionality. This coupled with the use of Java which is an object oriented programming allowed me to easily and effectivily develop a functional app. I believe developing android applications increased my comfrotability with object oriented designs and implementation, and additionally I used the debugger in my testing which is something I avoided beforehand because I was not very understand of what to use and look for. These two key skills are things I will contiue to apply in the future.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by using the adroid studio virtual environment, this allows for a android phone running your application to be used real time. This hands on testing approach allowed me to see where my app was crashing, or were it was functioniong. I coupled this with the use of the debugger to help me to overcome obstacles with the code.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In consideration of the full app design and development process from planning to finalization, I believe my biggest innovation was in the development process of the application. I felt most comfortable designing the app, and considering the UI elements. I had to overcome many technical issues with coding, and also understanding of how to implement certain functionaltiy. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe the component from my mobile app that I was most sucessful was the development of the database with SQLite, this portion was the easiest due to my knowledge of building database tables, and querying for data.
